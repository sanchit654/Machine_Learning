# Machine_Learning

Machine leaning is subset of artificial intelligence in a field of computer science. Machine learning is of three types:
1) Supervised learning
2) Unsupervised leaning
3) Rienforcement (semi-supervised) learning.

Under supervised learning we have `regression` and `classification`.\
Under unsupervised learning we have `clustering` and `association`.
